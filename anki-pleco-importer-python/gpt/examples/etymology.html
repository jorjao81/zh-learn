        <p><b>Origin: Phono-semantic compound (形声字)</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Traditional <span class="hanzi">憶</span> is analyzed as <b>从忄，意声</b>: the semantic component <span class="hanzi">忄</span> “heart, mind” signals mental activity, and the phonetic component <span class="hanzi">意</span> gives the sound <i>yì</i>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Simplified <span class="hanzi">忆</span> replaces the right-side <span class="hanzi">意</span> with a compact sign <span class="hanzi">乙</span> as a standard simplification. The pronunciation and phonetic lineage are clearer in the traditional form (with <span class="hanzi">意</span>), so treat <span class="hanzi">意</span> as the true phonetic for the family.

        <p><b>The Semantic Evolution:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>“heart/mind + idea” → “to recall/remember.”</b> The base meaning focuses on bringing something back to mind.
          </li>
          <li>
            Developed common nouns/compounds for <b>“memory”</b> or <b>“recollection.”</b> Examples: <span class="hanzi">记忆</span> “memory, to remember”; <span class="hanzi">回忆</span> “to recollect; recollection.”

            <b>Path:</b> 忄 “heart/mind” (semantic) + <span class="hanzi">意</span> (phonetic) → “to recall/keep in mind” → “memory; recollection.”
