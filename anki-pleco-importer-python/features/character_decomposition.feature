Feature: Character decomposition analysis
  As a Chinese language learner
  I want to see the structural components of Chinese characters
  So that I can understand their composition and meaning relationships

  Background:
    Given the CharacterDecomposer is available

  Scenario: Decompose semantic-phonetic compound character
    Given I have a Chinese character "清"

    When I try to decompose it
    Then I should get an error "Input must be a single Chinese character"

  Scenario: Decompose 3-character word using dictionary lookup
    Given I have the following Anki export dictionary:
      | chinese | pinyin   | definition |
      | 学      | xue2     | to learn   |
      | 习      | xi2      | to practice|
      | 学习    | xue2xi2  | to study   |
      | 生      | sheng1   | to give birth |
      | 活      | huo2     | to live    |
      | 生活    | sheng1huo2| life      |
    When I decompose the 3-character word "学习生"
    Then I should get the structural decomposition "学习(xuéxí - to study) + 生(shēng - to give birth)"

  Scenario: Decompose 4-character word preferring 2+2 split
    Given I have the following Anki export dictionary:
      | chinese | pinyin     | definition |
      | 学      | xue2       | to learn   |
      | 习      | xi2        | to practice|
      | 学习    | xue2xi2    | to study   |
      | 生      | sheng1     | to give birth |
      | 活      | huo2       | to live    |
      | 生活    | sheng1huo2 | life       |
    When I decompose the 4-character word "学习生活"
    Then I should get the structural decomposition "学习(xuéxí - to study) + 生活(shēnghuó - life)"

  Scenario: Decompose 4-character word with 3+1 split when no 2+2 available
    Given I have the following Anki export dictionary:
      | chinese | pinyin     | definition |
      | 学      | xue2       | to learn   |
      | 习      | xi2        | to practice|
      | 生      | sheng1     | to give birth |
      | 学习生  | xue2xi2sheng1| study life |
    When I decompose the 4-character word "学习生活"
    Then I should get the structural decomposition "学习生(xuéxíshēng - study life) + 活(huó - to live/alive/living/work/workmanship)"

  Scenario: Decompose 5-character word preferring longest matches
    Given I have the following Anki export dictionary:
      | chinese | pinyin       | definition |
      | 学      | xue2         | to learn   |
      | 习      | xi2          | to practice|
      | 生      | sheng1       | to give birth |
      | 活      | huo2         | to live    |
      | 学习    | xue2xi2      | to study   |
      | 生活    | sheng1huo2   | life       |
      | 方      | fang1        | direction  |
      | 式      | shi4         | style      |
      | 方式    | fang1shi4    | method     |
    When I decompose the 5-character word "学习生活方"
    Then I should get the structural decomposition "学习(xuéxí - to study) + 生活(shēnghuó - life) + 方(fāng - direction)"

  Scenario: Decompose word with no dictionary matches falls back to individual characters
    Given I have the following Anki export dictionary:
      | chinese | pinyin | definition |
      | 不      | bu4    | not        |
      | 存      | cun2   | to exist   |
      | 在      | zai4   | to be at   |
    When I decompose the 3-character word "不存在"
    Then I should get the structural decomposition "不(bù - not) + 存(cún - to exist) + 在(zài - to be at)"
