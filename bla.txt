ròujiāmó	肉夹馍		"lit. meat wedged in steamed bun; ""Chinese burger""; sliced meat sandwich popular in north China  The meat is most commonly pork, stewed for hours in a soup containing over 20 spices and seasonings. Although it is possible to use only a few spices (which many vendors do), the resulting meat is less flavourful.  The meat is minced or chopped and stuffed in ""baijimo"", a type of flatbread. An authentic baijimo is made from a wheat flour dough with yeast and then baked in a clay oven, but now in many parts of China, baijimo is made in a frying pan,[2] giving a taste that diverges significantly from the clay oven-baked version."			肉(meat/flesh/pulp) + 夹(to press from either side/to place in between/to sandwich/to carry sth under armpit/wedged between/between/to intersperse/to mix/to mingle/clip/folder) + 馍(small loaf of steamed bread)				y					
dàndanmiàn	担担面		noodle dish originating from Chinese Sichuan cuisine. It consists of a spicy sauce usually containing preserved vegetables (often including zha cai (榨菜), lower enlarged mustard stems, or ya cai (芽菜), upper mustard stems), chili oil, Sichuan pepper, minced pork, and scallions served over noodles. The dish can either be served dry or as a noodle soup.			"The name refers to a type of carrying pole (dan dan) that was used by walking street vendors who sold the dish to passers-by. The pole was carried over the shoulder, with two baskets containing noodles and sauce attached at either end. As the noodles were affordable due to their low cost, the local people gradually came to call them dandan noodles, referencing the street vendors. The name translates directly as ""noodles carried on a pole"", but may be better translated as ""peddler's noodles""."				y					
gǒubulǐbāozi	狗不理包子		Tianjin's homegrown snack. They are steamed buns stuffed with meat or vegetables			"狗不理包子 ""Goubuli"" literally means ""dog doesn't care"". This snack was created in the late Qing dynasty by a man from Wuqing Country whose nickname was ""Dog"". At the age of 14, Dog left home and came to Tianjin, where he became an apprentice at a restaurant specializing in baozi. A diligent and honest young man, Dog eventually opened a shop of his own. As his baozi tasted better and had a unique flavor, they attracted an increasing number of customers. As time went by, his nickname became known far and wide. Later, people changed his nickname from ""Dog"" to ""Dog doesn't care"" because he was often too busy to speak to his customers. His baozi was then named after his nickname. Today, with its main outlet located at Shandong Road, Heping District, the Goubuli Baozi Shop has developed into a corporation with 90 branch restaurants in Tianjin and 24 other Chinese cities. In addition to over 90 varieties of a stuffed bun, its restaurants also offer more than 200 dishes.[13]"		y		y

His well-known notion that ""Human nature is evil"" has led many commentators to place him opposite of Mencius, who believed human nature was intrinsically good.

Originally a divination manual in the Western Zhou period (1000–750 BC), the I Ching was transformed over the course of the Warring States and early imperial periods (500–200 BC) into a cosmological text with a series of philosophical commentaries known as the ""Ten Wings"".[1] After becoming part of the Five Classics in the 2nd century BC, the I Ching was the subject of scholarly commentary and the basis for divination practice for centuries across the Far East, and eventually took on an influential role in Western understanding of East Asian philosophical thought.[2]  As a divination text, the I Ching is used for a traditional Chinese form of cleromancy known as I Ching divination, in which bundles of yarrow stalks are manipulated to produce sets of six apparently random numbers ranging from 6 to 9. Each of the 64 possible sets corresponds to a hexagram, which can be looked up in the I Ching. The hexagrams are arranged in an order known as the King Wen sequence. The interpretation of the readings found in the I Ching has been endlessly discussed and debated over the centuries."
